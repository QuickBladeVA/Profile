# Profile
Hi There, Here is a Profile/Portfolio About me!
# Who am I
Hi, I’m Quick, a Game Developer with a focus on Programming and 3D Modeling. As the lead programmer in various team projects under Fathoms (or Fathom Students), I’ve honed my expertise in programming in Unity games.

Beyond programming, I’m a versatile creative with skills in voice acting, story writing, and 3D modeling. I’ve voiced characters ranging from serious narrators to whimsical fantasy heroes, offering a broad range of styles. My role as a Dungeon Master in Dungeons and Dragons has also sharpened my storytelling and world-building abilities, enabling me to craft memorable stories for players.

Though I primarily focus on programming, my curiosity and creativity drive me to explore and refine other skills like art design and narrative development.

# My Skills and Tools
Skills:

Programming, Critical Thinking, Adaptive, Creativity, Work Ethics, Computer literacy, Analytical

Programs I've used:

Game Engines: Unity, Roblox

3D Modeling: Blender, Maya

Programming & Design Tools: Visual Studio, Photoshop, Figma

Video/Sound Editor: Audacity, Adobe Audition, Davinci Resolve

Languages: C#, Python, Lua

I want to learn better coding and work on increasingly complex programming, with the ultimate goal of creating intelligent systems like ChatGPT—tools that simplify workflows and also enhance gaming experiences through smarter NPCs, dynamic storytelling, and gamebreaking mechanics. 

At the same time, I aspire to become a renowned voice actor, being an iconic voice that resonates with players and becomes a part of gaming history. Whether it’s a fierce warrior, a whimsical sidekick, or a dramatic narrator, I want my voice to bring characters to life that gives a lasting impact. 

Alongside these ambitions, I aim to hone my 3D modeling skills to create vibrant and expressive characters, drawing inspiration from the 2D/anime-stylized models in games like Zenless Zone Zero. By mastering this art form, I want to craft memorable characters that feel alive and visually stunning. 

Ultimately, my dream is to bring all these passions together to create a game that is not only fun to play but also builds a strong, vibrant community like those surrounding Valve games. I want to develop experiences that resonate with players, fostering connection and creativity, so that one day, when people see my name, they’ll say, “That’s the person who made that incredible game!”
