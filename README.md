# Profile / Portfolio

## Who am I
Hi, I’m Quick, a Game Developer with a focus on Programming and 3D Modeling. As the lead programmer in various team projects under Fathoms (or Fathom Students), I’ve honed my expertise in programming in Unity games.

Beyond programming, I’m a versatile creative with skills in voice acting, story writing, and 3D modeling. I’ve voiced characters ranging from serious narrators to whimsical fantasy heroes, offering a broad range of styles. My role as a Dungeon Master in Dungeons and Dragons has also sharpened my storytelling and world-building abilities, enabling me to craft memorable stories for players.

Though I primarily focus on programming, my curiosity and creativity drive me to explore and refine other skills like art design and narrative development.
